be in root
#sudo su

install java
#yum install java-1.8* -y

install tomcat

install package for ec2
#yum install wget -y


download directly on your ec2 instance
#wget <copied link from the .tar file>https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.56/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.56.tar.gz

#ls -l to confirm the file is there


Unzip the .tar file
#tar -zvxf <name of the file>

#ls -l - check whether it unzipped

enter the directory where it is downoaded
#cd  apache-tomcat-9.0.33

#ls -l
#cd /bin

check the permissions
# ls -ltr 

change the startup and shutdown services to executable
# chmod +x startup.sh
# chomd +x shutdown.sh
#ls -l to make sure they can execute 

Start the tomcat
go to the tomcat bin folder
# cd  apache-tomcat-9.0.33/bin
# ./startup.sh

shutdown
#./shutdown.sh

instead of the above, you can create a soft link with the path
#echo $PATH 
#ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.31/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatup
with this configured, you can run the tomcatup to start the service

#ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.31/bin/shutdown.sh //usr/local/bin/tomcatdown

start the service
#tomcatup


open the gui with the url on 8080

change the port to 8089

go back to tomcat directory
# cd ..

go to conf directory
#cd conf
#ls

locate file server.xml where the port is defined and change to 8090 and ctrl s
restart the service
#nano server.xml

restart service

Add 8090 to ec2 security group

from the gui, open the manager app (tells you you can only open it on the the machine running the tomcat)

(modify the contex.xml
find the contex.xml
#find / -name context.xml

copy the folder/path and edit
#nano /<paste the copied path>

comment the valve field with <!-- and close with -->
do for the 4 folders and restart tomcat
#tomcatdown
#tomcatup)

go edit the context.xml of the webapp folder>manager>hostmanager,manager>metainf folder
#nano context.xml
#ls -l
comment the valve field with <!.. and close with ..>


Refresh the gui connection and click the manger App

it will ask for username/password

on the conf location, locate a file called tomcat-users.xml
you need to add users with roles
#vi tomcat-users.xml

paste between lines of tomcat-users

<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manger-gui"/>
or
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>
